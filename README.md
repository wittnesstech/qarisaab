# Qari Saab


A `Data Visualisation` project
#

Can we dynamically plot **Al-Quran** on a `HTML` *canvas* using `JavaScript`...?

Here we *GO*

#
Made the app available at [Qari Saab](https://qarisaab.surge.sh)
We are now on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qarisaab)

Following was observed, and will serve as the TODO list :-
* [ ] Strange look on mobile screens

* [ ] Also very slow on mobiles, maybe it's something related to DPI


1. Design needs work
   * [ ] FG & BG colors suck
   * [ ] font size relatively small
   * [ ] The string are less physics-sy
   * [ ] long and short ayahs / relative words as to screen size
   * [ ] Beads need to engulf the word completely and go invisible soon
2. Functionaliity improvements
   * [ ] Reset / Reload button or something
   * [ ] SOUND
   * [ ] Multi-lingual stuff is required (Google translate **API** ?)
   * [ ] Click to do something *Interactively*
   * [ ] **Draggable** canvas
   * [ ] Selectable surahs / ayahs (need more *ideas*)
3. Drama Elements  
   * [x] Need to add versioning system 
   * [x] Publish to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qarisaab)
