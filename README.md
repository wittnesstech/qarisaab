## Qari Saab

##### A `Data Visualisation` Project

Hosted version of the app is available at [Qari Saab][hostedlink]

We are also on [npm][npmqarisaab]

### TODOs

- [x] Better UI based on [Vuetify][vuetifylink]

#### Functionaliity

#### p5 Canvas

- [ ] FG & BG colors suck
- [ ] Font size relatively small
- [ ] The string are less physics-sy
- [ ] Click to do something _Interactively_
- [x] **Draggable** canvas
  - [ ] Fix the draggable problem.... mousex || m.x
- [ ] Selectable surahs / ayahs (need more _ideas_)
- [ ] Long and short ayahs / relative words as to screen size - Why not use scrollview?
